## Description ##

Our motivation to make this project was to have a simple GIF search engine by utilizing a MERN stack single-page application with Sign Up, Login and Logout. One can get 20 GIFs at a time from each search prompt. We built this project to easily be able to search for a specific GIF to be able to use. Now with this project completed, we have learned throughout this project how to create an application that works with real-world data to solve a real-world challenge, with a focus on data and user demand.
